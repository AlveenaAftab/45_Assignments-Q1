//6. Stripping Names: 
//Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of 
//the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name 
//once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white 
//spaces.
